# A-Star Photo Editor
Thanks to CutsomTkinter for providing the awesome customizable widgets, their repo can be found at: https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/

This is a quite simple photo editing app for quick editing, mainly for applying filters.
Includes functionality to extract a color palette from an image, display image tag data, and export in JPG or PNG format (more formats might be added in the future).

More features are planned for future releases. Stay tuned :)

The app's theme adapts to your system settings.
This is a preview of the ligth theme:
